Q2.  Write a python program to print the sum and product of the first 10 natural numbers using for  and while loop. 
Ans -# Using for loop
sum_for = 0
product_for = 1
for i in range(1, 11):
    sum_for += i
    product_for *= i

print("Using for loop:")
print("Sum of the first 10 natural numbers:", sum_for)
print("Product of the first 10 natural numbers:", product_for)

# Using while loop
sum_while = 0
product_while = 1
num = 1
while num <= 10:
    sum_while += num
    product_while *= num
    num += 1

print("\nUsing while loop:")
print("Sum of the first 10 natural numbers:", sum_while)
print("Product of the first 10 natural numbers:", product_while)


Q3. Create a python program to compute the electricity bill for a household. 
The per-unit charges in rupees are as follows: For the first 100 units, the user will be charged Rs. 4.5 per  unit, for the next 100 units, the user will be charged Rs. 6 per unit, and for the next 100 units, the user will  be charged Rs. 10 per unit, After 300 units and above the user will be charged Rs. 20 per unit. You are required to take the units of electricity consumed in a month from the user as input. 
Your program must pass this test case: when the unit of electricity consumed by the user in a month is  310, the total electricity bill should be 2250. 
Ans - def calculate_electricity_bill(units):
    total_bill = 0
    
    if units <= 100:
        total_bill = units * 4.5
    elif units <= 200:
        total_bill = 100 * 4.5 + (units - 100) * 6
    elif units <= 300:
        total_bill = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + (units - 200) * 10
    else:
        total_bill = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + 100 * 10 + (units - 300) * 20
    
    return total_bill

# Taking input from the user
units_consumed = int(input("Enter the number of units consumed in a month: "))
bill_amount = calculate_electricity_bill(units_consumed)
print("Electricity bill: Rs.", bill_amount)

Q4. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Use for loop and while loop to calculate the cube of each  number and if the cube of that number is divisible by 4 or 5 then append that number in a list and print  that list. 
Ans - # Using for loop
cubes_divisible_for = []
for i in range(1, 101):
    cube = i ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        cubes_divisible_for.append(i)

print("Using for loop:", cubes_divisible_for)

# Using while loop
cubes_divisible_while = []
num = 1
while num <= 100:
    cube = num ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        cubes_divisible_while.append(num)
    num += 1

print("Using while loop:", cubes_divisible_while)


Q5.  Write a program to filter count vowels in the below-given string. 
string = "I want to become a data scientist" 
Ans - # Given string
string = "I want to become a data scientist"

# Define a function to count vowels
def count_vowels(s):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count

# Count vowels in the string
vowel_count = count_vowels(string)

# Print the result
print("Number of vowels in the string:", vowel_count)
